# E-MISSION NEW ARCHITECTURE

The e-mission new architecture is a series of system changes designed to support individualized user storage, policy choices, and requests. To facilitate this, we have composed a series of modules, mostly running in containers, which represent the various components. These components are:
    * System Controller
    * User Data Storage
    * Data Simulation
    * Data Aggregation
    * Data Querying
    * Multimachine Communication

Each of these will sections covered in more detail, along with the code added/changed to implement it. Additionally we made changes to produce a variety of new images for containers, 

## Installation
To get everything to work properly with the current implementation, you need a linux machine with the following installations:
    * Anaconda Python3
    * Ecryptfs
    * MongoDB
    * Docker
    * Docker-Compose
