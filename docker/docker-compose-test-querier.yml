    #Volumes is the preferred way to persist data generated by a container. In this case we use a volume to persist the contents
    #of the data base. Learn more about how to use volumes here: https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/
    # And learn how to configure volumes in your compose file here: https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#volume-configuration-reference
